# TuentilineFighter

*An arcade starship combat game programmed in 200 lines of code for a contest.*

This is my entry for a contest organized at [gemixstudio.com][1] to program a minigame 
with only 20 lines of Gemix code. It should be noted that an explicit definition of what
counted a line of code was given, and it did not include white lines, comments, and some
other things, to allow for clarity of code. So this game has a total 491 lines of code
(file tuentiline.prg), but it was close to 200 of qualifying lines of code.

This entry was the winner of the contest. I should note that I have been involved in
the Gemix compiler and interpreter, and that I was also one of the organizers of this 
contest. Before you start to cry foul play :), let me tell you that the jury was composed
of every contestant and forum member who wished to vote.
